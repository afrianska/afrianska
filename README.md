<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Afrian. 👋</h1>

A professional time-waster who still perform as a designer and web developer on the daily stage. I do something in the back stage when I'm off duty such as reading books, watching movies/series, "hangout" in online forum. I wish I could create content soon, either video or deal with my stuck to write article.
